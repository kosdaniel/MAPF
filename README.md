# Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) Program

## Overview

This C++ program demonstrates a simple implementation of the Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) algorithm. The program loads a map (a two-dimensional array with defined walls and empty spaces) and definitions of starting and ending locations for multiple agents. It then calculates collision-free paths for all agents from their respective start to finish positions using a naive MAPF algorithm. If a solution is successfully found, it is displayed as a console animation.

## Features

- **Load Map**: Supports loading a two-dimensional array representing the map, with walls and empty spaces.
- **Define Agents**: Allows specifying start and end locations for multiple agents or choosing random start and end locations for a specified number of agents.
- **Path Calculation**: Computes paths for agents ensuring no collisions occur during their movement.
- **Console Animation**: Displays the calculated paths as a console animation.
